 Scenario-Based Interview Questions on EC2, IAM, and VPC
 
 As part of my journey in DevOps and cloud architecture, I tackled several scenario-based questions to deepen my understanding of AWS services. Sharing my solutions here to benefit the cloud community:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Designing a VPC for a Highly Available, Scalable 2-Tier Application
To design a highly available and scalable architecture:

Create two subnets (public and private).
Public subnet hosts the load balancers, accessible from the internet.
Private subnet hosts application servers.
Distribute subnets across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
Use Auto Scaling Groups for dynamic scaling of application servers.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Restricting Outbound Internet Access in One Subnet

To restrict outbound internet for one subnet while allowing it for another:
Remove the default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the Internet Gateway in the route table for the restricted subnet.
For the other subnet, retain the route pointing to the Internet Gateway.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Enabling Private Subnet Instances to Access the Internet:

Use a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in the public subnet.
Update the private subnet‚Äôs route table to direct outbound traffic through the NAT Gateway.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Enabling Private IP Communication Between EC2 Instances:

Launch instances in the same VPC and security zone.
Verify that security groups are properly configured to allow communication between private IPs.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Strict Network Access Control:

Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) at the subnet level to define inbound/outbound rules.
Configure Security Groups at the instance level for granular traffic control.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Isolated Environment for Sensitive Workloads:
Create a subnet with no internet gateway attached for complete isolation.
Optionally, use a NAT Gateway for controlled outbound traffic when required.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Secure AWS Service Access in a VPC:

Use VPC Endpoints to privately access AWS services like S3 without needing internet gateways.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Difference Between NACL and Security Groups:

NACLs: Operate at the subnet level, stateless, used for broader traffic filtering.
Security Groups: Operate at the instance level, stateful, offer fine-grained access control.
Use Case: Combine NACLs and security groups for defense-in-depth network security.

9Ô∏è‚É£ IAM: Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies:

IAM Users: Permanent access credentials for individuals or applications.
IAM Groups: Manage permissions collectively for users.
IAM Roles: Temporary credentials for external applications or cross-account access.
IAM Policies: Define access permissions for AWS resources.

üîü Setting Up a Bastion Host for Secure Access to Private Subnet Instances:

Create an EC2 instance in a public subnet with a public IP.
Configure the bastion host's security group to allow inbound SSH or RDP traffic from trusted IPs.
Use the bastion host as a jump box to securely connect to instances in the private subnet.
