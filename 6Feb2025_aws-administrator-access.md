🚀 AWS AdministratorAccess Policy – What You Need to Know! 🔥

Many AWS users believe that attaching the AdministratorAccess policy gives them full control over their AWS account. While this is mostly true, there’s one key limitation:

❌ AdministratorAccess does NOT grant access to Billing & Cost Management by default!

By default, only the root user can access billing information. If you attach AdministratorAccess to an IAM user, they will have full control over AWS services except for billing.

✅ What AdministratorAccess Allows:
✔ Full access to all AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, etc.)
✔ Full control over IAM users, roles, and policies
✔ Ability to create, modify, and delete resources
✔ Full control over networking, security, and storage

❌ What It Doesn’t Grant:
🚫 Billing & Cost Management (must be enabled separately)
🚫 Root-only settings (closing the AWS account, changing root user credentials)
🚫 Managing AWS Support Plans

💡 How to Enable Billing Access for IAM Users:
1️⃣ Log in as the root user
2️⃣ Go to the AWS Billing Dashboard (Link)
3️⃣ Enable IAM access to billing under Billing Preferences
4️⃣ Attach the AWSBillingFullAccess policy to the IAM user

📌 Command to attach billing policy via AWS CLI:

aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name YourUserName --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSBillingFullAccess
This small step ensures your admins have full visibility into AWS costs while maintaining security best practices! 💡
