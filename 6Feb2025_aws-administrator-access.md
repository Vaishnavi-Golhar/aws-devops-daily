## 🚀 AWS AdministratorAccess Policy – What You Need to Know! 🔥

Many AWS users believe that attaching the **AdministratorAccess** policy gives them full control over their AWS account. While this is mostly true, there’s **one key limitation**:

❌ **AdministratorAccess does NOT grant access to Billing & Cost Management by default!**  

By default, only the **root user** can access billing information. If you attach **AdministratorAccess** to an IAM user, they will have full control over AWS services **except for billing**.

## ✅ What AdministratorAccess Allows:
✔ **Full access to all AWS services** (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, etc.)  
✔ **Full control over IAM users, roles, and policies**  
✔ **Ability to create, modify, and delete resources**  
✔ **Full control over networking, security, and storage**  

## ❌ What It Doesn’t Grant:
🚫 **Billing & Cost Management** (must be enabled separately)  
🚫 **Root-only settings** (closing the AWS account, changing root user credentials)  
🚫 **Managing AWS Support Plans**  

## 💡 How to Enable Billing Access for IAM Users:
1️⃣ **Log in as the root user**  
2️⃣ **Go to the AWS Billing Dashboard** ([AWS Billing Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home))  
3️⃣ **Enable IAM access to billing** under **Billing Preferences**  
4️⃣ **Attach the AWSBillingFullAccess policy** to the IAM user  

### 📌 Command to attach billing policy via AWS CLI:
```sh
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name YourUserName --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSBillingFullAccess
